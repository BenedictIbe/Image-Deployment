# Image-Deployment

This repository demonstrates a streamlined workflow for deploying images and image-related machine learning models in production environments. It focuses on creating a scalable pipeline for image processing, classification, and deployment using modern tools and frameworks.

# Features
- Image Processing
  - Preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
  - Batch processing for large-scale datasets.

- Model Deployment
  - Supports deployment of image classification and object detection models.
  - Integration with APIs for real-time inference.

- API Integration
  - Flask-based REST API for serving image models.
  - Handles image uploads and processes responses in real-time.

- Scalable Deployment
  - Dockerized application for consistent and portable deployments.
  - Cloud-ready architecture for deployment on AWS, GCP, or Azure.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment).
- Libraries: flask, numpy, opencv-python, tensorflow (or pytorch based on the model).

# Installation Steps
Clone the Repository

# bash
    git clone https://github.com/BenedictIbe/Image-Deployment.git  
    cd Image-Deployment  

# Install Required Libraries
  Use the following command to install dependencies:

# bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  

# Run the Application
Start the Flask API server:

# bash
    python app.py  

# Test the Deployment
  - Use tools like Postman or cURL to test the API endpoints.
  - Upload an image and verify the response.

# Project Workflow
  - Image Input
    - Accepts image uploads through the API or direct folder input.

  - Preprocessing
    - Applies transformations like resizing, normalization, or augmentation to prepare images for model inference.

  - Model Inference
    - Loads the pre-trained model and performs predictions on input images.

  - Response Generation
    - Sends back results in JSON format, including predictions and confidence scores.

  - Deployment
    - Containerized using Docker for easy scaling and consistent performance.

# Usage Examples
  # API Usage Example
  Send an image to the API for prediction:

# bash
    curl -X POST -F "file=@path_to_image.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict  

# Expected Response:
    json
    {  
      "predictions": [  
        {"label": "cat", "confidence": 0.95},  
        {"label": "dog", "confidence": 0.05}  
      ]  
    }  

# Docker Deployment
Build and run the Docker container:

# bash
    docker build -t image-deployment .  
    docker run -p 5000:5000 image-deployment
